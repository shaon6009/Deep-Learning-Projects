and i had purpose\\r\\nonce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,\\r\\nor lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out\\r\\ntwelve several times, and i have nightly since\\r\\ndreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;\\r\\nwe have been down together in my sleep,\\r\\nunbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,\\r\\nand waked half dead with nothing. worthy marcius,\\r\\nhad we no quarrel else to rome, but that\\r\\nthou art thence banish'd, we would muster all\\r\\nfrom twelve to seventy, and pouring war\\r\\ninto the bowels of ungrateful rome,\\r\\nlike a bold flood o'er-bear. o, come, go in,\\r\\nand take our friendly senators by the hands;\\r\\nwho now are here, taking their leaves of me,\\r\\nwho am prepared against your territories,\\r\\nthough not for rome itself.\\r\\n\\r\\ncoriolanus:\\r\\nyou bless me, gods!\\r\\n\\r\\naufidius:\\r\\ntherefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have\\r\\nthe leading of thine own revenges, take\\r\\nthe one half of my commission;

looking as it were--would i were hanged,\\r\\nbut i thought there was more in him than i could think.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond servingman:\\r\\nso did i, i'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest\\r\\nman i' the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\ni think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond servingman:\\r\\nwho, my master?\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\nnay, it's no matter for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond servingman:\\r\\nworth six on him.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\nnay, not so neither: but i take him to be the\\r\\ngreater soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond servingman:\\r\\nfaith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:\\r\\nfor the defence of a town, our general is excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\nay, and for an assault too.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird servingman:\\r\\no slaves, i can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\nwhat, what, what? let's partake.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird servingman:\\r\\ni would not be a roman, of all nations;

i have heard him say so himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\nhe was too hard for him directly, to say the troth\\r\\non't: before corioli he scotched him and notched\\r\\nhim like a carbon ado.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond servingman:\\r\\nan he had been cannibally given, he might have\\r\\nbroiled and eaten him too.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\nbut, more of thy news?\\r\\n\\r\\nthird servingman:\\r\\nwhy, he is so made on here within, as if he were son\\r\\nand heir to mars; set at upper end o' the table; no\\r\\nquestion asked him by any of the senators, but they\\r\\nstand bald before him: our general himself makes a\\r\\nmistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and\\r\\nturns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. but\\r\\nthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'\\r\\nthe middle and but one half of what he was\\r\\nyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty\\r\\nand grant of the whole table. he'll go, he says,\\r\\nand sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears: he\\r\\nwill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond servingman:\\r\\nand he's as like to do't as any man i can imagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird servingman:\\r\\ndo't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as\\r\\nmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it\\r\\nwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as\\r\\nwe term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\ndirectitude! what's that?\\r\\n\\r\\nthird servingman:\\r\\nbut when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,\\r\\nand the man in blood, they will out of their\\r\\nburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\nbut when goes this forward?\\r\\n\\r\\nthird servingman:\\r\\nto-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the\\r\\ndrum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a\\r\\nparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they\\r\\nwipe their lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond servingman:\\r\\nwhy, then we shall have a stirring world again.\\r\\nthis peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase\\r\\ntailors, and breed ballad-makers.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst servingman:\\r\\nlet me have war, say i;

lost their hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nlord willoughby:\\r\\nand daily new exactions are devised,\\r\\nas blanks, benevolences, and i wot not what:\\r\\nbut what, o' god's name, doth become of this?\\r\\n\\r\\nnorthumberland:\\r\\nwars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,\\r\\nbut basely yielded upon compromise\\r\\nthat which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:\\r\\nmore hath he spent in peace than they in wars.\\r\\n\\r\\nlord ross:\\r\\nthe earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nlord willoughby:\\r\\nthe king's grown bankrupt, like a broken

departing of the king for ireland.\\r\\nif then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,\\r\\nimp out our drooping country's broken wing,\\r\\nredeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,\\r\\nwipe off

myself will go.\\r\\n\\r\\nlord ross:\\r\\nto horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.\\r\\n\\r\\nlord willoughby:\\r\\nhold out my horse, and i will first be there.\\r\\n\\r\\nbushy:\\r\\nmadam, your majesty is too much sad:\\r\\nyou promised, when you parted with the king,\\r\\nto lay aside life-harming heaviness\\r\\nand entertain a cheerful disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen:\\r\\nto please the king i did; to please myself\\r\\ni cannot do it; yet i know no cause\\r\\nwhy i should welcome such a guest as grief,\\r\\nsave bidding farewell to so sweet a guest\\r\\nas my sweet richard: yet again, methinks,\\r\\nsome unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,\\r\\nis coming towards me, and my inward soul\\r\\nwith nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,\\r\\nmore than with parting from my lord the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nbushy:\\r\\neach substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,\\r\\nwhich shows like grief itself, but is not so;\\r\\nfor sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,\\r\\ndivides one thing entire to many objects;\\r\\nlike perspectives, which rightly gazed upon\\r\\nshow nothing but confusion, eyed awry\\r\\ndistinguish

is not. then, thrice-gracious queen,\\r\\nmore than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;\\r\\nor if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,\\r\\nwhich for things true weeps things imaginary.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen:\\r\\nit may be so; but yet my inward soul\\r\\npersuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,\\r\\ni cannot but be sad; so heavy sad\\r\\nas, though on thinking on no thought i think,\\r\\nmakes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.\\r\\n\\r\\nbushy:\\r\\n'tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen:\\r\\n'tis nothing less: conceit is still

possess;\\r\\nbut what it is, that is not yet known; what\\r\\ni cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, i wot.\\r\\n\\r\\ngreen:\\r\\ngod save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:\\r\\ni hope the king is not yet shipp'd for ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen:\\r\\nwhy hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;\\r\\nfor his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:\\r\\nthen wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?\\r\\n\\r\\ngreen:\\r\\nthat he, our hope, might have retired his power,\\r\\nand driven into despair an enemy's hope,\\r\\nwho strongly hath set footing in this land:\\r\\nthe banish'd bolingbroke repeals himself,\\r\\nand with uplifted arms is safe arrived\\r\\nat

sits fair for news to go to ireland,\\r\\nbut none returns. for us to levy power\\r\\nproportionable to the enemy\\r\\nis all unpossible.\\r\\n\\r\\ngreen:\\r\\nbesides, our nearness to the king in

to walk abroad;\\r\\nwhere, underneath the grove of sycamore\\r\\nthat westward rooteth from the city's side,\\r\\nso early walking did i see your son:\\r\\ntowards him i made, but he was ware of me\\r\\nand stole into the covert of the wood:\\r\\ni, measuring his affections by my own,\\r\\nthat most are busied when they're most alone,\\r\\npursued my humour not pursuing his,\\r\\nand gladly

son,\\r\\nand private in his chamber pens himself,\\r\\nshuts up his windows, locks far daylight out\\r\\nand makes himself an artificial night:\\r\\nblack and portentous must this humour

impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nrichard:\\r\\nan oath is of no moment, being not took\\r\\nbefore a true and lawful magistrate,\\r\\nthat hath authority over him that swears:\\r\\nhenry had none, but did usurp the place;\\r\\nthen, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,\\r\\nyour oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.\\r\\ntherefore, to arms! and, father, do but think\\r\\nhow sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;\\r\\nwithin whose circuit is elysium\\r\\nand all that poets feign of bliss and joy.\\r\\nwhy do we finger thus? i cannot rest\\r\\nuntil the white rose that i wear be dyed\\r\\neven in the

do take my leave.\\r\\nsir john and sir hugh mortimer, mine uncles,\\r\\nyou are come to sandal in a happy hour;\\r\\nthe army of the queen mean to besiege us.\\r\\n\\r\\njohn mortimer:\\r\\nshe shall

with him!\\r\\n\\r\\ntutor:\\r\\nah, clifford, murder not this innocent child,\\r\\nlest thou be hated both of god and man!\\r\\n\\r\\nclifford:\\r\\nhow now! is he dead already? or is it fear\\r\\nthat makes him close his eyes? i'll open them.\\r\\n\\r\\nrutland:\\r\\nso looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch\\r\\nthat trembles under his devouring paws;\\r\\nand so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,\\r\\nand so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.\\r\\nah, gentle clifford, kill me with thy sword,\\r\\nand not with such a cruel threatening look.\\r\\nsweet clifford, hear me speak before i die.\\r\\ni am too mean a subject for thy wrath:\\r\\nbe thou revenged on men, and let me live.\\r\\n\\r\\nclifford:\\r\\nin vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood\\r\\nhath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.\\r\\n\\r\\nrutland:\\r\\nthen let my father's blood open it again:\\r\\nhe is a man, and, clifford, cope with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nclifford:\\r\\nhad thy brethren here, their lives and thine\\r\\nwere not revenge sufficient for me;\\r\\nno, if i digg'd up thy forefathers' graves\\r\\nand hung their rotten coffins up in chains,\\r\\nit could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.\\r\\nthe sight of any of the house of york\\r\\nis as a fury to torment my soul;\\r\\nand till i root out their accursed line\\r\\nand leave not one alive, i live in hell.\\r\\ntherefore--\\r\\n\\r\\nrutland:\\r\\no, let me pray before i take my death!\\r\\nto thee i pray; sweet clifford, pity me!\\r\\n\\r\\nclifford:\\r\\nsuch pity as my rapier's point

themselves\\r\\nlike men born to renown by life or death.\\r\\nthree times did richard make a lane to me.\\r\\nand thrice cried 'courage, father! fight it out!'\\r\\nand full as oft came edward to my side,\\r\\nwith purple falchion, painted to the hilt\\r\\nin blood of those that had encounter'd him:\\r\\nand when the hardiest warriors did retire,\\r\\nrichard cried 'charge! and give no foot of ground!'\\r\\nand cried 'a crown, or else a glorious tomb!\\r\\na sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'\\r\\nwith this, we charged again: but, out, alas!\\r\\nwe bodged again; as i have seen a swan\\r\\nwith bootless labour swim against the tide\\r\\nand spend her strength with over-matching waves.\\r\\nah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;\\r\\nand i am faint and cannot fly their

or foe, let him be gently used.\\r\\n\\r\\nrichard:\\r\\nrevoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis clifford;\\r\\nwho not contented that he lopp'd the branch\\r\\nin hewing rutland when his leaves put forth,\\r\\nbut set his murdering knife unto the root\\r\\nfrom whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,\\r\\ni mean our princely father, duke of york.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nfrom off the gates of york fetch down the head,\\r\\nyour father's head, which clifford placed there;\\r\\ninstead whereof let this supply the room:\\r\\nmeasure for measure must be answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nedward:\\r\\nbring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,\\r\\nthat nothing sung but death to us and ours:\\r\\nnow death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,\\r\\nand his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\ni think his understanding is bereft.\\r\\nspeak, clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?\\r\\ndark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,\\r\\nand he nor sees nor hears us what we say.\\r\\n\\r\\nrichard:\\r\\no, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:\\r\\n'tis but his policy to counterfeit,\\r\\nbecause he would avoid such bitter taunts\\r\\nwhich in the time of death he gave our father.\\r\\n\\r\\ngeorge:\\r\\nif so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.\\r\\n\\r\\nrichard:\\r\\nclifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.\\r\\n\\r\\nedward:\\r\\nclifford, repent in bootless penitence.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nclifford, devise excuses for thy faults.\\r\\n\\r\\ngeorge:\\r\\nwhile we devise fell tortures for thy faults.\\r\\n\\r\\nrichard:\\r\\nthou didst love york, and i am son to york.\\r\\n\\r\\nedward:\\r\\nthou pitied'st rutland; i will pity thee.\\r\\n\\r\\ngeorge:\\r\\nwhere's captain margaret, to fence you now?\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nthey mock thee, clifford: swear as thou wast wont.\\r\\n\\r\\nrichard:\\r\\nwhat, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard\\r\\nwhen clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.\\r\\ni know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,\\r\\nif this right hand would buy two hour's life,\\r\\nthat i in all despite might rail at him,\\r\\nthis hand should chop it off, and with the\\r\\nissuing blood\\r\\nstifle the villain whose unstanched thirst\\r\\nyork and young rutland could not satisfy.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,\\r\\nand rear it in the place your father's stands.\\r\\nand now to london with triumphant march,\\r\\nthere to be crowned england's royal king:\\r\\nfrom whence shall warwick cut the sea to france,\\r\\nand ask the lady bona for thy queen:\\r\\nso shalt thou sinew both these lands together;\\r\\nand, having france thy friend, thou shalt not dread\\r\\nthe scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;\\r\\nfor though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,\\r\\nyet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.\\r\\nfirst will i see the coronation;\\r\\nand then to brittany i'll cross the sea,\\r\\nto effect this marriage, so it please my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nedward:\\r\\neven as thou wilt, sweet warwick, let it be;\\r\\nfor in thy shoulder do i build my seat,\\r\\nand never will i undertake the thing\\r\\nwherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.\\r\\nrichard, i will create thee duke of gloucester,\\r\\nand george, of clarence: warwick, as ourself,\\r\\nshall do and undo as him pleaseth best.\\r\\n\\r\\nrichard:\\r\\nlet me be duke of clarence, george of gloucester;\\r\\nfor gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\ntut, that's a foolish observation:\\r\\nrichard, be duke of gloucester. now to london,\\r\\nto see these honours in possession.\\r\\n3 king henry vi\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst keeper:\\r\\nunder this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;\\r\\nfor through this laund anon the deer will come;\\r\\nand in this covert will we make our stand,\\r\\nculling the principal of all the deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\ni'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst keeper:\\r\\nthat cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow\\r\\nwill scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.\\r\\nhere stand we both, and aim we at the best:\\r\\nand, for the time shall not seem tedious,\\r\\ni'll tell thee what befell me on a day\\r\\nin this self-place where now we mean to stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\nhere comes a man; let's stay till he be past.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nfrom scotland am i stol'n, even of pure love,\\r\\nto greet mine own land with my wishful sight.\\r\\nno, harry, harry, 'tis no land of thine;\\r\\nthy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,\\r\\nthy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:\\r\\nno bending knee will call thee caesar now,\\r\\nno humble suitors press to

the quondam king; let's seize upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nlet me embrace thee, sour adversity,\\r\\nfor wise men say it is the wisest course.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\nwhy linger we? let us lay hands upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst keeper:\\r\\nforbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nmy queen and son are gone to france for aid;\\r\\nand, as i hear, the great commanding warwick\\r\\nis thither gone, to crave the french king's sister\\r\\nto wife for edward: if this news be true,\\r\\npoor queen and son, your labour is but lost;\\r\\nfor warwick is a subtle orator,\\r\\nand lewis a prince soon won with moving words.\\r\\nby this account then margaret may win him;\\r\\nfor she's a woman to be pitied much:\\r\\nher sighs will make a battery in his breast;\\r\\nher tears will pierce into a marble heart;\\r\\nthe tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;\\r\\nand nero will be tainted with remorse,\\r\\nto hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.\\r\\nay, but she's come to beg, warwick to give;\\r\\nshe, on his left side, craving aid for henry,\\r\\nhe, on his right, asking a wife for edward.\\r\\nshe weeps, and says her henry is deposed;\\r\\nhe smiles, and says his edward is install'd;\\r\\nthat she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;\\r\\nwhiles warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,\\r\\ninferreth arguments of mighty strength,\\r\\nand in conclusion wins the king from her,\\r\\nwith promise of his sister, and what else,\\r\\nto strengthen and support king edward's place.\\r\\no margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,\\r\\nart then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\nsay, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nmore than i seem, and less than i was born to:\\r\\na man at least, for less i should not be;\\r\\nand men may talk of kings, and why not i?\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\nay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nwhy, so i am, in mind; and that's enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\nbut, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nmy crown is in my heart, not on my head;\\r\\nnot decked with diamonds and indian stones,\\r\\nnor to be seen: my crown is called content:\\r\\na crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\nwell, if you be a king crown'd with content,\\r\\nyour crown content and you must be contented\\r\\nto go along with us; for as we think,\\r\\nyou are the king king edward hath deposed;\\r\\nand we his subjects sworn in all allegiance\\r\\nwill apprehend you as his enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nbut did you never swear, and break an oath?\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\nno, never such an oath; nor will not now.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nwhere did you dwell when i was king of england?\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond keeper:\\r\\nhere in this country, where we now remain.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\ni was anointed king at nine months old;\\r\\nmy father and my grandfather were kings,\\r\\nand you were sworn true subjects unto me:\\r\\nand tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst keeper:\\r\\nno;\\r\\nfor we were subjects but while you were king.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nwhy, am i dead? do i not breathe a man?\\r\\nah, simple men, you know not what you swear!\\r\\nlook, as i blow this feather from my face,\\r\\nand as the air blows it to me again,\\r\\nobeying with my wind when i do blow,\\r\\nand yielding to another when it blows,\\r\\ncommanded always by the greater gust;\\r\\nsuch is the lightness of you common men.\\r\\nbut do not break your oaths; for of that sin\\r\\nmy mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.\\r\\ngo where you will, the king shall be commanded;\\r\\nand be you kings, command, and i'll obey.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst keeper:\\r\\nwe are true subjects to the king, king edward.\\r\\n\\r\\nking

pause.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwidow, we will consider of your suit;\\r\\nand come some other time to know our

me.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nhow many children hast thou, widow? tell me.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nthree, my most gracious lord.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\n'twere pity they should lose their

wit.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nnow tell me, madam, do you love your children?\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nay, full as dearly as i love myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nand would you not do much to do them good?\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nto do them good, i would sustain some harm.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nthen get your husband's lands, to do them good.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\ntherefore i came unto your majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\ni'll tell you how these lands are to be got.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nso shall you bind me to your highness' service.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwhat service wilt thou do me, if i give them?\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nwhat you command, that rests in me to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nbut you will take exceptions to my boon.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nno, gracious lord, except i cannot do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nay, but thou canst do what i mean to ask.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nwhy, then i will do what your grace commands.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nwhy stops my lord, shall i not hear my task?\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nan easy task; 'tis but to love a king.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nthat's soon perform'd, because i am a subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwhy, then, thy husband's lands i freely give thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\ni take my leave with many thousand thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nbut stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love i mean.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nthe fruits of love i mean, my loving liege.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nay, but, i fear me, in another sense.\\r\\nwhat love, think'st thou, i sue so much to get?\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nmy love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;\\r\\nthat love which virtue begs and virtue grants.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nno, by my troth, i did not mean such love.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nwhy, then you mean not as i thought you did.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nbut now you partly may perceive my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nmy mind will never grant what i perceive\\r\\nyour highness aims at, if i aim aright.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nto tell thee plain, i aim to lie with thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nto tell you plain, i had rather lie in prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwhy, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nwhy, then mine honesty shall be my dower;\\r\\nfor by that loss i will not purchase them.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\ntherein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.\\r\\n\\r\\nlady grey:\\r\\nherein your highness wrongs both them and me.\\r\\nbut, mighty lord, this merry inclination\\r\\naccords not with the sadness of my suit:\\r\\nplease you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my

sad.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nyou'll think it strange if i should marry her.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nto whom, my lord?\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwhy, clarence, to myself.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nthat would be ten days' wonder at the least.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nthat's a day longer than a wonder lasts.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nby so much is the wonder in extremes.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwell, jest on, brothers: i can tell you both\\r\\nher suit is granted for her husband's lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nnobleman:\\r\\nmy gracious lord, henry your foe is taken,\\r\\nand brought your prisoner to your palace gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nsee that he be convey'd unto the tower:\\r\\nand go we, brothers, to the man that took him,\\r\\nto question of his apprehension.\\r\\nwidow, go you along. lords, use her honourably.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nay, edward will use women honourably.\\r\\nwould he were wasted, marrow, bones and

buried--\\r\\nis clarence, henry, and his son young edward,\\r\\nand all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,\\r\\nto take their rooms, ere i can place myself:\\r\\na cold premeditation for my purpose!\\r\\nwhy, then, i do but dream on sovereignty;\\r\\nlike one that stands upon a promontory,\\r\\nand spies a far-off shore where he would tread,\\r\\nwishing his foot were equal with his eye,\\r\\nand chides the sea that sunders him from thence,\\r\\nsaying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:\\r\\nso do i wish the crown, being so far off;\\r\\nand so i chide the means that keeps me from it;\\r\\nand so i say, i'll cut the causes off,\\r\\nflattering me with impossibilities.\\r\\nmy eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,\\r\\nunless my hand and strength could equal them.\\r\\nwell, say there is no kingdom then for richard;\\r\\nwhat other pleasure can the world afford?\\r\\ni'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,\\r\\nand deck my body in gay ornaments,\\r\\nand witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.\\r\\no miserable thought! and more unlikely\\r\\nthan to accomplish twenty golden crowns!\\r\\nwhy, love forswore me in my mother's womb:\\r\\nand, for i should not deal in her soft laws,\\r\\nshe did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,\\r\\nto shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;\\r\\nto make an envious mountain on my back,\\r\\nwhere sits deformity to mock my body;\\r\\nto shape my legs of an unequal size;\\r\\nto disproportion me in every part,\\r\\nlike to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp\\r\\nthat carries no impression like the dam.\\r\\nand am i then a man to be beloved?\\r\\no monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!\\r\\nthen, since this earth affords no joy to me,\\r\\nbut to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such\\r\\nas are of better person than myself,\\r\\ni'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,\\r\\nand, whiles i live, to account this world but hell,\\r\\nuntil my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head\\r\\nbe round impaled with a glorious crown.\\r\\nand yet i know not how to get the crown,\\r\\nfor many lives stand between me and home:\\r\\nand i,--like one lost in a thorny wood,\\r\\nthat rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,\\r\\nseeking a way and straying from the way;\\r\\nnot knowing how to find the open air,\\r\\nbut toiling desperately to find it out,--\\r\\ntorment myself to catch the english crown:\\r\\nand from that torment i will free myself,\\r\\nor hew my way out with a bloody axe.\\r\\nwhy, i can smile, and murder whiles i smile,\\r\\nand cry 'content' to that which grieves my heart,\\r\\nand wet my cheeks with artificial tears,\\r\\nand frame my face to all occasions.\\r\\ni'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;\\r\\ni'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;\\r\\ni'll play the orator as well as nestor,\\r\\ndeceive more slily than ulysses could,\\r\\nand, like a sinon, take another troy.\\r\\ni can add colours to the chameleon,\\r\\nchange shapes with proteus for advantages,\\r\\nand set the murderous machiavel to school.\\r\\ncan i do this, and cannot get a crown?\\r\\ntut, were it farther off, i'll pluck it down.\\r\\n3 king henry

days:\\r\\nbut now mischance hath trod my title down,\\r\\nand with dishonour laid me on the ground;\\r\\nwhere i must take like seat unto my fortune,\\r\\nand to my humble seat conform myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nwhy, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nfrom such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears\\r\\nand stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nwhate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,\\r\\nand sit thee by our side:\\r\\nyield not thy neck\\r\\nto fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind\\r\\nstill ride in triumph over all mischance.\\r\\nbe plain, queen margaret, and tell thy grief;\\r\\nit shall be eased, if france can yield relief.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nthose gracious words revive my drooping thoughts\\r\\nand give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.\\r\\nnow, therefore, be it known to noble lewis,\\r\\nthat henry, sole possessor of my love,\\r\\nis of a king become a banish'd man,\\r\\nand forced to live in scotland a forlorn;\\r\\nwhile proud ambitious edward duke of york\\r\\nusurps the regal title and the seat\\r\\nof england's true-anointed lawful king.\\r\\nthis is the cause that i, poor margaret,\\r\\nwith this my son, prince edward, henry's heir,\\r\\nam come to crave thy just and lawful aid;\\r\\nand if thou fail us, all our hope is done:\\r\\nscotland hath will to help, but cannot help;\\r\\nour people and our peers are both misled,\\r\\nour treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,\\r\\nand, as thou

friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nwelcome, brave warwick! what brings thee to france?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nay, now begins a second storm to rise;\\r\\nfor this is he that moves both wind and tide.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nfrom worthy edward, king of albion,\\r\\nmy lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,\\r\\ni come, in kindness and unfeigned love,\\r\\nfirst, to do greetings to thy royal person;\\r\\nand then to crave a league of amity;\\r\\nand lastly, to confirm that amity\\r\\nwith a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant\\r\\nthat virtuous lady bona, thy fair sister,\\r\\nto england's king in lawful marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nking lewis and lady bona, hear me speak,\\r\\nbefore you answer warwick. his demand\\r\\nsprings not from edward's well-meant honest love,\\r\\nbut from deceit bred by necessity;\\r\\nfor how can tyrants safely govern home,\\r\\nunless abroad they purchase great alliance?\\r\\nto prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,\\r\\nthat henry liveth still: but were he dead,\\r\\nyet here prince edward stands, king henry's son.\\r\\nlook, therefore, lewis, that by this league and marriage\\r\\nthou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;\\r\\nfor though usurpers sway the rule awhile,\\r\\nyet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\ninjurious margaret!\\r\\n\\r\\nprince edward:\\r\\nand why not queen?\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nbecause thy father henry did usurp;\\r\\nand thou no more are prince than she is queen.\\r\\n\\r\\noxford:\\r\\nthen warwick disannuls great john of gaunt,\\r\\nwhich did subdue the greatest part of spain;\\r\\nand, after john of gaunt, henry the fourth,\\r\\nwhose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;\\r\\nand, after that wise prince, henry the fifth,\\r\\nwho by his prowess conquered all france:\\r\\nfrom these our henry lineally descends.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\noxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,\\r\\nyou told not how henry the sixth hath lost\\r\\nall that which henry fifth had gotten?\\r\\nmethinks these peers of france should smile at that.\\r\\nbut for the rest, you tell a pedigree\\r\\nof threescore and two years; a silly time\\r\\nto make prescription for a kingdom's worth.\\r\\n\\r\\noxford:\\r\\nwhy, warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,\\r\\nwhom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,\\r\\nand not bewray thy treason with a blush?\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\ncan oxford, that did ever fence the right,\\r\\nnow buckler falsehood with a pedigree?\\r\\nfor shame! leave henry, and call edward king.\\r\\n\\r\\noxford:\\r\\ncall him my king by whose injurious doom\\r\\nmy elder brother, the lord

not!\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nnow warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,\\r\\nis edward your true king? for i were loath\\r\\nto link with him that were not lawful chosen.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nthereon i pawn my credit and mine honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nbut is he gracious in the people's eye?\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nthe more that henry was unfortunate.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nthen further, all dissembling set aside,\\r\\ntell me for truth the measure of his love\\r\\nunto our sister bona.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nsuch it seems\\r\\nas may beseem a monarch like himself.\\r\\nmyself have often heard him say and swear\\r\\nthat this his love was an eternal plant,\\r\\nwhereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,\\r\\nthe leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,\\r\\nexempt from envy, but not from disdain,\\r\\nunless the lady bona quit his pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nnow, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nbona:\\r\\nyour grant, or your denial, shall be mine:\\r\\nyet i confess that often ere this day,\\r\\nwhen i have heard your king's desert recounted,\\r\\nmine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nthen, warwick, thus: our sister shall be edward's;\\r\\nand now forthwith shall articles be drawn\\r\\ntouching the jointure that your king must make,\\r\\nwhich with her dowry shall be counterpoised.\\r\\ndraw near, queen margaret, and be a witness\\r\\nthat bona shall be wife to the english king.\\r\\n\\r\\nprince edward:\\r\\nto edward, but not to the english king.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\ndeceitful warwick! it was thy device\\r\\nby this alliance to make void my suit:\\r\\nbefore thy coming lewis was henry's friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nand still is friend to him and margaret:\\r\\nbut if your title to the crown be weak,\\r\\nas may appear by edward's good success,\\r\\nthen 'tis but reason that i be released\\r\\nfrom giving aid which late i promised.\\r\\nyet shall you have all kindness at my hand\\r\\nthat your estate requires and mine can yield.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nhenry now lives in scotland at his ease,\\r\\nwhere having nothing, nothing can he lose.\\r\\nand as for you yourself, our quondam queen,\\r\\nyou have a father able to maintain you;\\r\\nand better 'twere you troubled him than france.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\npeace, impudent and shameless warwick, peace,\\r\\nproud setter up and puller down of kings!\\r\\ni will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,\\r\\nboth full of truth, i make king lewis behold\\r\\nthy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;\\r\\nfor both of you are birds of selfsame feather.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nwarwick, this is some post to us or thee.\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\n\\r\\noxford:\\r\\ni like it well that our fair queen and mistress\\r\\nsmiles at her news, while warwick frowns at his.\\r\\n\\r\\nprince edward:\\r\\nnay, mark how lewis stamps, as he were nettled:\\r\\ni hope all's for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nwarwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nmine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nmine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nwhat! has your king married the lady grey!\\r\\nand now, to soothe your forgery and his,\\r\\nsends me a paper to persuade me patience?\\r\\nis this the alliance that he seeks with france?\\r\\ndare he presume to scorn us in this manner?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\ni told your majesty as much before:\\r\\nthis proveth edward's love and warwick's honesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nking lewis, i here protest, in sight of heaven,\\r\\nand by the hope i have of heavenly bliss,\\r\\nthat i am clear from this misdeed of edward's,\\r\\nno more my king, for he dishonours me,\\r\\nbut most himself, if he could see his shame.\\r\\ndid i forget that by the house of york\\r\\nmy father came untimely to his death?\\r\\ndid i let pass the abuse done to my niece?\\r\\ndid i impale him with the regal crown?\\r\\ndid i put henry from his native right?\\r\\nand am i guerdon'd at the last with shame?\\r\\nshame on himself! for my desert is honour:\\r\\nand to repair my honour lost for him,\\r\\ni here renounce him and return to henry.\\r\\nmy noble queen, let former grudges pass,\\r\\nand henceforth i am thy true servitor:\\r\\ni will revenge his wrong to lady bona,\\r\\nand replant henry in his former state.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nwarwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;\\r\\nand i forgive and quite forget old faults,\\r\\nand joy that thou becomest king henry's friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nso much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,\\r\\nthat, if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us\\r\\nwith some few bands of chosen soldiers,\\r\\ni'll undertake to land them on our coast\\r\\nand force the tyrant from his seat by war.\\r\\n'tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:\\r\\nand as for clarence, as my letters tell me,\\r\\nhe's very likely now to fall from him,\\r\\nfor matching more for wanton lust than honour,\\r\\nor than for strength and safety of our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nbona:\\r\\ndear brother, how shall bona be revenged\\r\\nbut by thy help to this distressed queen?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nrenowned prince, how shall poor henry live,\\r\\nunless thou rescue him from foul despair?\\r\\n\\r\\nbona:\\r\\nmy quarrel and this english queen's are one.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nand mine, fair lady bona, joins with yours.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nand mine with hers, and thine, and margaret's.\\r\\ntherefore at last i firmly am resolved\\r\\nyou shall have aid.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nlet me give humble thanks for all at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nthen, england's messenger, return in post,\\r\\nand tell false edward, thy supposed king,\\r\\nthat lewis of france is sending over masquers\\r\\nto revel it with him and his new bride:\\r\\nthou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.\\r\\n\\r\\nbona:\\r\\ntell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,\\r\\ni'll wear the willow garland for his sake.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\ntell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,\\r\\nand i am ready to put armour on.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\ntell him from me that he hath done me wrong,\\r\\nand therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long.\\r\\nthere's thy reward: be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nbut, warwick,\\r\\nthou and oxford, with five thousand men,\\r\\nshall cross the seas, and bid false edward battle;\\r\\nand, as occasion serves, this noble queen\\r\\nand prince shall follow with a fresh supply.\\r\\nyet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,\\r\\nwhat pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nthis shall assure my constant loyalty,\\r\\nthat if our queen and this young prince agree,\\r\\ni'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy\\r\\nto him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen margaret:\\r\\nyes, i agree, and thank you for your motion.\\r\\nson edward, she is fair and virtuous,\\r\\ntherefore delay not, give thy hand to warwick;\\r\\nand, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,\\r\\nthat only warwick's daughter shall be thine.\\r\\n\\r\\nprince edward:\\r\\nyes, i accept her, for she well deserves it;\\r\\nand here, to pledge my vow, i give my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nking lewis xi:\\r\\nwhy stay we now? these soldiers shall be levied,\\r\\nand thou, lord bourbon, our high admiral,\\r\\nshalt waft them over with our royal fleet.\\r\\ni long till edward fall by war's mischance,\\r\\nfor mocking marriage with a dame of france.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\ni came from edward as ambassador,\\r\\nbut i return his sworn and mortal foe:\\r\\nmatter of marriage was the charge he gave me,\\r\\nbut dreadful war shall answer his demand.\\r\\nhad he none else to make a stale but me?\\r\\nthen none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow.\\r\\ni was the chief that raised him to the crown,\\r\\nand i'll be chief to bring him down again:\\r\\nnot that i pity henry's misery,\\r\\nbut seek revenge on edward's mockery.\\r\\n3 king henry vi\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nnow tell me, brother clarence, what think you\\r\\nof this new marriage with the lady grey?\\r\\nhath not our brother made a worthy choice?\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nalas, you know, 'tis far from hence to france;\\r\\nhow could he stay till warwick made return?\\r\\n\\r\\nsomerset:\\r\\nmy lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nand his well-chosen bride.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\ni mind to tell him plainly what i think.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nnow, brother of clarence, how like you our choice,\\r\\nthat you stand pensive, as half malcontent?\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nas well as lewis of france, or the earl of warwick,\\r\\nwhich are so weak of courage and in judgment\\r\\nthat they'll take no offence at our abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nsuppose they take offence without a cause,\\r\\nthey are but lewis and warwick: i am edward,\\r\\nyour king and warwick's, and must have my will.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nand shall have your will, because our king:\\r\\nyet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nyea, brother richard, are you offended too?\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nnot i:\\r\\nno, god forbid that i should wish them sever'd\\r\\nwhom god hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity\\r\\nto sunder them that yoke so well together.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nsetting your scorns and your mislike aside,\\r\\ntell me some reason why the lady grey\\r\\nshould not become my wife and england's queen.\\r\\nand you too, somerset and montague,\\r\\nspeak freely what you think.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nthen this is mine opinion: that king lewis\\r\\nbecomes your enemy, for mocking him\\r\\nabout the marriage of the lady bona.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nand warwick, doing what you gave in charge,\\r\\nis now dishonoured by this new marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwhat if both lewis and warwick be appeased\\r\\nby such invention as i can devise?\\r\\n\\r\\nmontague:\\r\\nyet, to have join'd with france in such alliance\\r\\nwould more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth\\r\\n'gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nhastings:\\r\\nwhy, knows not montague that of itself\\r\\nengland is safe, if true within itself?\\r\\n\\r\\nmontague:\\r\\nbut the safer when 'tis back'd with france.\\r\\n\\r\\nhastings:\\r\\n'tis better using france than trusting france:\\r\\nlet us be back'd with god and with the seas\\r\\nwhich he hath given for fence impregnable,\\r\\nand with their helps only defend ourselves;\\r\\nin them and in ourselves our safety lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nfor this one speech lord hastings well deserves\\r\\nto have the heir of the lord hungerford.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nay, what of that? it was my will and grant;\\r\\nand for this once my will shall stand for law.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nand yet methinks your grace hath not done well,\\r\\nto give the heir and daughter of lord scales\\r\\nunto the brother of your loving bride;\\r\\nshe better would have fitted me or clarence:\\r\\nbut in your bride you bury brotherhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nor else you would not have bestow'd the heir\\r\\nof the lord bonville on your new wife's son,\\r\\nand leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nalas, poor clarence! is it for a wife\\r\\nthat thou art malcontent? i will provide thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nin choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,\\r\\nwhich being shallow, you give me leave\\r\\nto play the broker in mine own behalf;\\r\\nand to that end i shortly mind to leave you.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nleave me, or tarry, edward will be king,\\r\\nand not be tied unto his brother's will.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen elizabeth:\\r\\nmy lords, before it pleased his majesty\\r\\nto raise my state to title of a queen,\\r\\ndo me but right, and you must all confess\\r\\nthat i was not ignoble of descent;\\r\\nand meaner than myself have had like fortune.\\r\\nbut as this title honours me and mine,\\r\\nso your dislike, to whom i would be pleasing,\\r\\ndoth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nmy love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:\\r\\nwhat danger or what sorrow can befall thee,\\r\\nso long as edward is thy constant friend,\\r\\nand their true sovereign, whom they must obey?\\r\\nnay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,\\r\\nunless they seek for hatred at my hands;\\r\\nwhich if they do, yet will i keep thee safe,\\r\\nand they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nnow, messenger, what letters or what news\\r\\nfrom france?\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\nmy sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,\\r\\nbut such as i, without your special pardon,\\r\\ndare not relate.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\ngo to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,\\r\\ntell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.\\r\\nwhat answer makes king lewis unto our letters?\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\nat my depart, these were his very words:\\r\\n'go tell false edward, thy supposed king,\\r\\nthat lewis of france is sending over masquers\\r\\nto revel it with him and his new bride.'\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nis lewis so brave? belike he thinks me henry.\\r\\nbut what said lady bona to my marriage?\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\nthese were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:\\r\\n'tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,\\r\\ni'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\ni blame not her, she could say little less;\\r\\nshe had the wrong. but what said henry's queen?\\r\\nfor i have heard that she was there in place.\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\n'tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,\\r\\nand i am ready to put armour on.'\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nbelike she minds to play the amazon.\\r\\nbut what said warwick to these injuries?\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\nhe, more incensed against your majesty\\r\\nthan all the rest, discharged me with these words:\\r\\n'tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,\\r\\nand therefore i'll uncrown him ere't be long.'\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?\\r\\nwell i will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:\\r\\nthey shall have wars and pay for their presumption.\\r\\nbut say, is warwick friends with margaret?\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\nay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in\\r\\nfriendship\\r\\nthat young prince edward marries warwick's daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nbelike the elder; clarence will have the younger.\\r\\nnow, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,\\r\\nfor i will hence to warwick's other daughter;\\r\\nthat, though i want a kingdom, yet in marriage\\r\\ni may not prove inferior to yourself.\\r\\nyou that love me and warwick, follow me.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nclarence and somerset both gone to warwick!\\r\\nyet am i arm'd against the worst can happen;\\r\\nand haste is needful in this desperate case.\\r\\npembroke and stafford, you in our behalf\\r\\ngo levy men, and make prepare for war;\\r\\nthey are already, or quickly will be landed:\\r\\nmyself in person will straight follow you.\\r\\nbut, ere i go, hastings and montague,\\r\\nresolve my doubt. you twain, of all the rest,\\r\\nare near to warwick by blood and by alliance:\\r\\ntell me if you love warwick more than me?\\r\\nif it be so, then both depart to him;\\r\\ni rather wish you foes than hollow friends:\\r\\nbut if you mind to hold your true obedience,\\r\\ngive me assurance with some friendly vow,\\r\\nthat i may never have you in suspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nmontague:\\r\\nso god help montague as he proves true!\\r\\n\\r\\nhastings:\\r\\nand hastings as he favours edward's cause!\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nnow, brother richard, will you stand by us?\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwhy, so! then am i sure of victory.\\r\\nnow therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,\\r\\ntill we meet warwick with his foreign power.\\r\\n3 king henry vi\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\ntrust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;\\r\\nthe common people by numbers swarm to us.\\r\\nbut see where somerset and clarence come!\\r\\nspeak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nfear not that, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nthen, gentle clarence, welcome unto warwick;\\r\\nand welcome, somerset: i hold it cowardice\\r\\nto rest mistrustful where a noble heart\\r\\nhath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;\\r\\nelse might i think that clarence, edward's brother,\\r\\nwere but a feigned friend to our proceedings:\\r\\nbut welcome, sweet clarence; my daughter shall be thine.\\r\\nand now what rests but, in night's coverture,\\r\\nthy brother being carelessly encamp'd,\\r\\nhis soldiers lurking in the towns about,\\r\\nand but attended by a simple guard,\\r\\nwe may surprise and take him at our pleasure?\\r\\nour scouts have found the adventure very easy:\\r\\nthat as ulysses and stout diomede\\r\\nwith sleight and manhood stole to rhesus' tents,\\r\\nand brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds,\\r\\nso we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,\\r\\nat unawares may beat down edward's guard\\r\\nand seize himself; i say not, slaughter him,\\r\\nfor i intend but only to surprise him.\\r\\nyou that will follow me to this attempt,\\r\\napplaud the name of henry with your leader.\\r\\nwhy, then, let's on our way in silent sort:\\r\\nfor warwick and his friends, god and saint george!\\r\\n3 king henry vi\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst watchman:\\r\\ncome on, my masters, each man take his stand:\\r\\nthe king by this is set him down to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond watchman:\\r\\nwhat, will he not to bed?\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst watchman:\\r\\nwhy, no; for he hath made a solemn vow\\r\\nnever to lie and take his natural rest\\r\\ntill warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond watchman:\\r\\nto-morrow then belike shall be the day,\\r\\nif warwick be so near as men report.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird watchman:\\r\\nbut say, i pray, what nobleman is that\\r\\nthat with the king here resteth in his tent?\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst watchman:\\r\\n'tis the lord hastings, the king's chiefest friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird watchman:\\r\\no, is it so? but why commands the king\\r\\nthat his chief followers lodge in towns about him,\\r\\nwhile he himself keeps in the cold field?\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond watchman:\\r\\n'tis the more honour, because more dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird watchman:\\r\\nay, but give me worship and quietness;\\r\\ni like it better than a dangerous honour.\\r\\nif warwick knew in what estate he stands,\\r\\n'tis to be doubted he would waken him.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst watchman:\\r\\nunless our halberds did shut up his passage.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond watchman:\\r\\nay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,\\r\\nbut to defend his person from night-foes?\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nthis is his tent; and see where stand his guard.\\r\\ncourage, my masters! honour now or never!\\r\\nbut follow me, and edward shall be ours.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst watchman:\\r\\nwho goes there?\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond watchman:\\r\\nstay, or thou diest!\\r\\n\\r\\nsomerset:\\r\\nwhat are they that fly there?\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nrichard and hastings: let them go; here is the duke.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nthe duke! why, warwick, when we parted,\\r\\nthou call'dst me king.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nay, but the case is alter'd:\\r\\nwhen you disgraced me in my embassade,\\r\\nthen i degraded you from being king,\\r\\nand come now to create you duke of york.\\r\\nalas! how should you govern any kingdom,\\r\\nthat know not how to use ambassadors,\\r\\nnor how to be contented with one wife,\\r\\nnor how to use your brothers brotherly,\\r\\nnor how to study for the people's welfare,\\r\\nnor how to shroud yourself from enemies?\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nyea, brother of clarence, are thou here too?\\r\\nnay, then i see that edward needs must down.\\r\\nyet, warwick, in despite of all mischance,\\r\\nof thee thyself and all thy complices,\\r\\nedward will always bear himself as king:\\r\\nthough fortune's malice overthrow my state,\\r\\nmy mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nthen, for his mind, be edward england's king:\\r\\nbut henry now shall wear the english crown,\\r\\nand be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.\\r\\nmy lord of somerset, at my request,\\r\\nsee that forthwith duke edward be convey'd\\r\\nunto my brother, archbishop of york.\\r\\nwhen i have fought with pembroke and his fellows,\\r\\ni'll follow you, and tell what answer\\r\\nlewis and the lady bona send to him.\\r\\nnow, for a while farewell, good duke of york.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwhat fates impose, that men must needs abide;\\r\\nit boots not to resist both wind and tide.\\r\\n\\r\\noxford:\\r\\nwhat now remains, my lords, for us to do\\r\\nbut march to london with our soldiers?\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nay, that's the first thing that we have to do;\\r\\nto free king henry from imprisonment\\r\\nand see him seated in the regal throne.\\r\\n3 king henry vi\\r\\n\\r\\nrivers:\\r\\nmadam, what makes you in this sudden change?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen elizabeth:\\r\\nwhy brother rivers, are you yet to learn\\r\\nwhat late misfortune is befall'n king edward?\\r\\n\\r\\nrivers:\\r\\nwhat! loss of some pitch'd battle against warwick?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen elizabeth:\\r\\nno, but the loss of his own royal person.\\r\\n\\r\\nrivers:\\r\\nthen is my sovereign slain?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen elizabeth:\\r\\nay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,\\r\\neither betray'd by falsehood of his guard\\r\\nor by his foe surprised at unawares:\\r\\nand, as i further have to understand,\\r\\nis new committed to the bishop of york,\\r\\nfell warwick's brother and by that our foe.\\r\\n\\r\\nrivers:\\r\\nthese news i must confess are full of grief;\\r\\nyet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:\\r\\nwarwick may lose, that now hath won the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen elizabeth:\\r\\ntill then fair hope must hinder life's decay.\\r\\nand i the rather wean me from despair\\r\\nfor love of edward's offspring in my womb:\\r\\nthis is it that makes me bridle passion\\r\\nand bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;\\r\\nay, ay, for this i draw in many a tear\\r\\nand stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,\\r\\nlest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown\\r\\nking edward's fruit, true heir to the english crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nrivers:\\r\\nbut, madam, where is warwick then become?\\r\\n\\r\\nqueen elizabeth:\\r\\ni am inform'd that he comes towards london,\\r\\nto set the crown once more on henry's head:\\r\\nguess thou the rest; king edward's friends must down,\\r\\nbut, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--\\r\\nfor trust not him that hath once broken faith,--\\r\\ni'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,\\r\\nto save at least the heir of edward's right:\\r\\nthere shall i rest secure from force and fraud.\\r\\ncome, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:\\r\\nif warwick take us we are sure to die.\\r\\n3 king henry vi\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nnow, my lord hastings and sir william stanley,\\r\\nleave off to wonder why i drew you hither,\\r\\ninto this chiefest thicket of the park.\\r\\nthus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,\\r\\nis prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands\\r\\nhe hath good usage and great liberty,\\r\\nand, often but attended with weak guard,\\r\\ncomes hunting this way to disport himself.\\r\\ni have advertised him by secret means\\r\\nthat if about this hour he make his way\\r\\nunder the colour of his usual game,\\r\\nhe shall here find his friends with horse and men\\r\\nto set him free from his captivity.\\r\\n\\r\\nhuntsman:\\r\\nthis way, my lord; for this way lies the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nnay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.\\r\\nnow, brother of gloucester, lord hastings, and the rest,\\r\\nstand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nbrother, the time and case requireth haste:\\r\\nyour horse stands ready at the park-corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nbut whither shall we then?\\r\\n\\r\\nhastings:\\r\\nto lynn, my lord,\\r\\nand ship from thence to flanders.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nwell guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nstanley, i will requite thy forwardness.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nbut wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nhuntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?\\r\\n\\r\\nhuntsman:\\r\\nbetter do so than tarry and be hang'd.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\ncome then, away; let's ha' no more ado.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nbishop, farewell: shield thee from warwick's frown;\\r\\nand pray that i may repossess the crown.\\r\\n3 king henry vi\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nmaster lieutenant, now that god and friends\\r\\nhave shaken edward from the regal seat,\\r\\nand turn'd my captive state to liberty,\\r\\nmy fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,\\r\\nat our enlargement what are thy due fees?\\r\\n\\r\\nlieutenant:\\r\\nsubjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;\\r\\nbut if an humble prayer may prevail,\\r\\ni then crave pardon of your majesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nfor what, lieutenant? for well using me?\\r\\nnay, be thou sure i'll well requite thy kindness,\\r\\nfor that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;\\r\\nay, such a pleasure as incaged birds\\r\\nconceive when after many moody thoughts\\r\\nat last by notes of household harmony\\r\\nthey quite forget their loss of liberty.\\r\\nbut, warwick, after god, thou set'st me free,\\r\\nand chiefly therefore i thank god and thee;\\r\\nhe was the author, thou the instrument.\\r\\ntherefore, that i may conquer fortune's spite\\r\\nby living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,\\r\\nand that the people of this blessed land\\r\\nmay not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,\\r\\nwarwick, although my head still wear the crown,\\r\\ni here resign my government to thee,\\r\\nfor thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nyour grace hath still been famed for virtuous;\\r\\nand now may seem as wise as virtuous,\\r\\nby spying and avoiding fortune's malice,\\r\\nfor few men rightly temper with the stars:\\r\\nyet in this one thing let me blame your grace,\\r\\nfor choosing me when clarence is in

and war;\\r\\nand therefore i yield thee my free consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nand i choose clarence only for protector.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nwarwick and clarence give me both your hands:\\r\\nnow join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,\\r\\nthat no dissension hinder government:\\r\\ni make you both protectors of this land,\\r\\nwhile i myself will lead a private life\\r\\nand in devotion spend my latter days,\\r\\nto sin's rebuke and my creator's praise.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nwhat answers clarence to his sovereign's will?\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nthat he consents, if warwick yield consent;\\r\\nfor on thy fortune i repose myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nwhy, then, though loath, yet must i be content:\\r\\nwe'll yoke together, like a double shadow\\r\\nto henry's body, and supply his place;\\r\\ni mean, in bearing weight of government,\\r\\nwhile he enjoys the honour and his ease.\\r\\nand, clarence, now then it is more than needful\\r\\nforthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor,\\r\\nand all his lands and goods be confiscate.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nwhat else? and that succession be determined.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nay, therein clarence shall not want his part.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nbut, with the first of all your chief affairs,\\r\\nlet me entreat, for i command no more,\\r\\nthat margaret your queen and my son edward\\r\\nbe sent for, to return from france with speed;\\r\\nfor, till i see them here, by doubtful fear\\r\\nmy joy of liberty is half eclipsed.\\r\\n\\r\\nclarence:\\r\\nit shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nmy lord of somerset, what youth is that,\\r\\nof whom you seem to have so tender care?\\r\\n\\r\\nsomerset:\\r\\nmy liege, it is young henry, earl of richmond.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\ncome hither, england's hope.\\r\\nif secret powers\\r\\nsuggest but truth to my divining thoughts,\\r\\nthis pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.\\r\\nhis looks are full of peaceful majesty,\\r\\nhis head by nature framed to wear a crown,\\r\\nhis hand to wield a sceptre, and himself\\r\\nlikely in time to bless a regal throne.\\r\\nmake much of him, my lords, for this is he\\r\\nmust help you more than you are hurt by me.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nwhat news, my friend?\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\nthat edward is escaped from your brother,\\r\\nand fled, as he hears since, to burgundy.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nunsavoury news! but how made he escape?\\r\\n\\r\\npost:\\r\\nhe was convey'd by richard duke of gloucester\\r\\nand the lord hastings, who attended him\\r\\nin secret ambush on the forest side\\r\\nand from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;\\r\\nfor hunting was his daily exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nwarwick:\\r\\nmy brother was too careless of his charge.\\r\\nbut let us hence, my sovereign, to provide\\r\\na salve for any sore that may betide.\\r\\n\\r\\nsomerset:\\r\\nmy lord, i like not of this flight of edward's;\\r\\nfor doubtless burgundy will yield him help,\\r\\nand we shall have more wars before 't be long.\\r\\nas henry's late presaging prophecy\\r\\ndid glad my heart with hope of this young richmond,\\r\\nso doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts\\r\\nwhat may befall him, to his harm and ours:\\r\\ntherefore, lord oxford, to prevent the worst,\\r\\nforthwith we'll send him hence to brittany,\\r\\ntill storms be past of civil enmity.\\r\\n\\r\\noxford:\\r\\nay, for if edward repossess the crown,\\r\\n'tis like that richmond with the rest shall down.\\r\\n\\r\\nsomerset:\\r\\nit shall be so; he shall to brittany.\\r\\ncome, therefore, let's about it speedily.\\r\\n3 king henry

for henry's regal crown.\\r\\nwell have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas\\r\\nand brought desired help from burgundy:\\r\\nwhat then remains, we being thus arrived\\r\\nfrom ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york,\\r\\nbut that we enter, as into our dukedom?\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nthe gates made fast! brother, i like not this;\\r\\nfor many men that stumble at the threshold\\r\\nare well foretold that danger lurks within.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\ntush, man, abodements must not now affright us:\\r\\nby fair or foul means we must enter in,\\r\\nfor hither

alone.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\n\\r\\nhastings:\\r\\nwhy, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?\\r\\nopen the gates; we are king henry's friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nmayor:\\r\\nay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\na wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!\\r\\n\\r\\nhastings:\\r\\nthe good old man would fain that all were well,\\r\\nso 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,\\r\\ni doubt not, i, but we shall soon persuade\\r\\nboth him and all his brothers unto reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nso, master mayor: these gates must not be shut\\r\\nbut in the night or in the time of war.\\r\\nwhat! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;\\r\\nfor edward will defend the town and thee,\\r\\nand all those friends that deign to follow me.\\r\\n\\r\\ngloucester:\\r\\nbrother, this is sir john montgomery,\\r\\nour trusty friend, unless i be deceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nwelcome, sir john! but why come you in arms?\\r\\n\\r\\nmontague:\\r\\nto help king edward in his time of storm,\\r\\nas every loyal subject ought to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nthanks, good montgomery; but we now forget\\r\\nour title to the crown and only claim\\r\\nour dukedom till god please to send the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nmontague:\\r\\nthen fare you well, for i will hence again:\\r\\ni came to serve a king and not a duke.\\r\\ndrummer, strike up, and let us march away.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nnay, stay, sir john, awhile, and we'll debate\\r\\nby what safe means the crown may be

fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.\\r\\nbrother, we will proclaim you out of hand:\\r\\nthe bruit thereof will bring you many friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nking edward iv:\\r\\nthen be it as you will; for 'tis my right,\\r\\nand henry but usurps the diadem.\\r\\n\\r\\nmontague:\\r\\nay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;\\r\\nand now will i be edward's champion.\\r\\n\\r\\nhastings:\\r\\nsound

lordship?\\r\\nmethinks the power that edward hath in field\\r\\nshould not be able to encounter mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nexeter:\\r\\nthe doubt is that he will seduce the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nking henry vi:\\r\\nthat's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:\\r\\ni have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,\\r\\nnor posted off their suits with slow delays;\\r\\nmy pity hath been balm to heal their

champions;\\r\\ntwo cliffords, as the father and the son,\\r\\nand two northumberlands; two braver men\\r\\nne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;\\r\\nwith them, the two brave bears,

been royally attorneyed\\r\\nwith interchange of gifts, letters, loving\\r\\nembassies; that they have seemed to be together,\\r\\nthough absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and\\r\\nembraced, as it

unspeakable\\r\\ncomfort of your young prince mamillius: it is a\\r\\ngentleman of the greatest promise that ever came\\r\\ninto my note.\\r\\n\\r\\ncamillo:\\r\\ni very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it\\r\\nis a gallant child; one that indeed physics the\\r\\nsubject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on\\r\\ncrutches ere he was born desire yet their life to\\r\\nsee him a man.\\r\\n\\r\\narchidamus:\\r\\nwould they else be content to die?\\r\\n\\r\\ncamillo:\\r\\nyes; if there were no other excuse why they should\\r\\ndesire to live.\\r\\n\\r\\narchidamus:\\r\\nif the

would do that\\r\\nwhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\\r\\nhis cupbearer,--whom i from meaner form\\r\\nhave benched and reared to worship, who mayst see\\r\\nplainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\\r\\nhow i am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,\\r\\nto give mine enemy a lasting wink;\\r\\nwhich draught to me were cordial.\\r\\n\\r\\ncamillo:\\r\\nsir, my lord,\\r\\ni could do this, and that with no rash potion,\\r\\nbut with a lingering dram that should not work\\r\\nmaliciously like poison: but i cannot\\r\\nbelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\\r\\nso

from me and\\r\\nso leaves me to consider what is breeding\\r\\nthat changeth thus his manners.\\r\\n\\r\\ncamillo:\\r\\ni dare not know, my lord.\\r\\n\\r\\npolixenes:\\r\\nhow! dare not! do not. do you know, and dare not?\\r\\nbe intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;\\r\\nfor, to yourself, what you do know, you must.\\r\\nand cannot say, you dare not. good camillo,\\r\\nyour changed complexions are to me a mirror\\r\\nwhich shows me mine changed too; for i must be\\r\\na party in this alteration, finding\\r\\nmyself thus alter'd with 't.\\r\\n\\r\\ncamillo:\\r\\nthere is a sickness\\r\\nwhich puts some of us in distemper, but\\r\\ni cannot name the disease; and it is caught\\r\\nof you that yet are well.\\r\\n\\r\\npolixenes:\\r\\nhow! caught of me!\\r\\nmake me not sighted like the basilisk:\\r\\ni have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better\\r\\nby my regard, but kill'd none so. camillo,--\\r\\nas you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\\r\\nclerk-like

better not to\\r\\nhave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having\\r\\nmade me businesses which none without thee can\\r\\nsufficiently manage, must either stay to execute\\r\\nthem thyself or take away with thee the very\\r\\nservices thou hast done; which if i have not enough\\r\\nconsidered, as too much i cannot, to be more\\r\\nthankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit\\r\\ntherein the heaping friendships. of that fatal\\r\\ncountry, sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very\\r\\nnaming punishes me with the remembrance of that\\r\\npenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,\\r\\nmy brother; whose loss of his most precious queen\\r\\nand children are even now to be afresh lamented.\\r\\nsay to me, when sawest thou the prince florizel, my\\r\\nson? kings are no less unhappy, their issue not\\r\\nbeing gracious, than they are in losing them when\\r\\nthey have approved their virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\ncamillo:\\r\\nsir, it is three days since i saw the prince. what\\r\\nhis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but i\\r\\nhave missingly noted, he is of late much retired\\r\\nfrom court and is less frequent to his princely\\r\\nexercises than formerly he hath appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\npolixenes:\\r\\ni have considered so much, camillo, and with some\\r\\ncare; so far that i have eyes under my service which\\r\\nlook upon his removedness; from whom i have this\\r\\nintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a\\r\\nmost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from\\r\\nvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of his\\r\\nneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\\r\\n\\r\\ncamillo:\\r\\ni have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a\\r\\ndaughter of most rare note: the report of her is\\r\\nextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\\r\\n\\r\\npolixenes:\\r\\nthat's likewise part of my intelligence; but, i\\r\\nfear, the angle that plucks our son thither. thou\\r\\nshalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not\\r\\nappearing what we are, have some question with the\\r\\nshepherd; from whose simplicity i think it not\\r\\nuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.\\r\\nprithee, be my present partner in this business, and\\r\\nlay aside the thoughts of sicilia.\\r\\n\\r\\ncamillo:\\r\\ni willingly obey your command.\\r\\n\\r\\npolixenes:\\r\\nmy best camillo! we must disguise ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nautolycus:\\r\\nwhen daffodils begin to peer,\\r\\nwith heigh! the doxy over the dale,\\r\\nwhy, then comes in the sweet o' the year;\\r\\nfor the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.\\r\\nthe white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\\r\\nwith heigh! the sweet birds, o, how they sing!\\r\\ndoth set my pugging tooth on edge;\\r\\nfor a quart of ale is a dish for a king.\\r\\nthe lark, that tirra-lyra chants,\\r\\nwith heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,\\r\\nare summer songs for me and my aunts,\\r\\nwhile we lie tumbling in the hay.\\r\\ni have served prince florizel and in my time\\r\\nwore three-pile;

only this methought i\\r\\nheard the shepherd say, he found the child.\\r\\n\\r\\nautolycus:\\r\\ni would most gladly know the issue of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst gentleman:\\r\\ni make a broken delivery of the business; but the\\r\\nchanges i perceived in the king and camillo were\\r\\nvery notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with\\r\\nstaring on one another, to tear the cases of their\\r\\neyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language\\r\\nin their very gesture; they looked as they had heard\\r\\nof a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable\\r\\npassion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest\\r\\nbeholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not\\r\\nsay if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the\\r\\nextremity of the one, it must needs be.\\r\\nhere comes a gentleman that haply knows more.\\r\\nthe news, rogero?\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond gentleman:\\r\\nnothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the\\r\\nking's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is\\r\\nbroken out within this hour that ballad-makers\\r\\ncannot be able to express it.\\r\\nhere comes the lady paulina's steward: he can\\r\\ndeliver you more. how goes it now, sir? this news\\r\\nwhich is called true is so like an old tale, that\\r\\nthe verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king\\r\\nfound his heir?\\r\\n\\r\\nthird gentleman:\\r\\nmost true, if ever truth were pregnant by\\r\\ncircumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you\\r\\nsee, there is such unity in the proofs. the mantle\\r\\nof queen hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,\\r\\nthe letters of antigonus found with it which they\\r\\nknow to be his character, the majesty of the\\r\\ncreature in resemblance of the mother, the affection\\r\\nof nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,\\r\\nand many other evidences proclaim her with all\\r\\ncertainty to be the king's daughter. did you see\\r\\nthe meeting of the two kings?\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond gentleman:\\r\\nno.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird gentleman:\\r\\nthen have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,\\r\\ncannot be spoken of. there might you have beheld one\\r\\njoy crown another, so and in such manner that it\\r\\nseemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their\\r\\njoy waded in tears. there was casting up of eyes,\\r\\nholding up of hands, with countenances of such\\r\\ndistraction that they were to be known by garment,\\r\\nnot by favour. our king, being ready to leap out of\\r\\nhimself for joy of his found daughter, as if that\\r\\njoy were now become a loss, cries 'o, thy mother,\\r\\nthy mother!' then asks bohemia forgiveness; then\\r\\nembraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his\\r\\ndaughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old\\r\\nshepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten\\r\\nconduit of many kings' reigns. i never heard of such\\r\\nanother encounter, which lames report to follow it\\r\\nand undoes description to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond gentleman:\\r\\nwhat, pray you, became of antigonus, that carried\\r\\nhence the child?\\r\\n\\r\\nthird gentleman:\\r\\nlike an old tale still, which will have matter to\\r\\nrehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear\\r\\nopen. he was torn to pieces with a bear: this\\r\\navouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his\\r\\ninnocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a\\r\\nhandkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst gentleman:\\r\\nwhat became of his bark and his followers?\\r\\n\\r\\nthird gentleman:\\r\\nwrecked the same instant of their master's death and\\r\\nin the view of the shepherd: so that all the\\r\\ninstruments which aided to expose the child were\\r\\neven then lost when it was found. but o, the noble\\r\\ncombat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in\\r\\npaulina! she had one eye declined for the loss of\\r\\nher husband, another elevated that the oracle was\\r\\nfulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,\\r\\nand so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin\\r\\nher to her heart that she might no more be in danger\\r\\nof losing.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst gentleman:\\r\\nthe dignity of this act was worth the audience of\\r\\nkings and princes; for by such was it acted.\\r\\n\\r\\nthird gentleman:\\r\\none of the prettiest touches of all and that which\\r\\nangled for mine eyes, caught the water though not\\r\\nthe fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's\\r\\ndeath, with the manner how she came to't bravely\\r\\nconfessed and lamented by the king, how\\r\\nattentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one\\r\\nsign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'alas,'\\r\\ni would fain say, bleed tears, for i am sure my\\r\\nheart wept blood. who was most marble there changed\\r\\ncolour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world\\r\\ncould have seen 't, the woe had been universal.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst gentleman:\\r\\nare they returned to the court?\\r\\n\\r\\nthird gentleman:\\r\\nno: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,\\r\\nwhich is in the keeping of paulina,--a piece many\\r\\nyears in doing and now newly performed by that rare\\r\\nitalian master, julio romano, who, had he himself\\r\\neternity and could put breath into his work, would\\r\\nbeguile nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her\\r\\nape: he so near to hermione hath done hermione that\\r\\nthey say one would speak to her and stand in hope of\\r\\nanswer: thither with all greediness of affection\\r\\nare they gone, and there they intend to sup.\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond gentleman:\\r\\ni thought she had some great matter there in hand;\\r\\nfor she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever\\r\\nsince the death of hermione, visited that removed\\r\\nhouse. shall we thither and with our company piece\\r\\nthe rejoicing?\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst gentleman:\\r\\nwho would be thence that has the benefit of access?\\r\\nevery wink of an eye some new grace will be born:\\r\\nour absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.\\r\\nlet's along.\\r\\n\\r\\nautolycus:\\r\\nnow, had i not the dash of my former life in me,\\r\\nwould preferment drop on my head. i brought the old\\r\\nman and his son aboard the prince: told him i heard\\r\\nthem talk of a fardel and i know not what: but he\\r\\nat that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,\\r\\nso he then took her to be, who began to be much\\r\\nsea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of\\r\\nweather continuing, this mystery remained\\r\\nundiscovered. but 'tis all one to me; for had i\\r\\nbeen the finder out of this secret, it would not\\r\\nhave relished among my other discredits.\\r\\nhere come those i have done good to against my will,\\r\\nand already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nshepherd:\\r\\ncome, boy; i am past moe children, but thy sons and\\r\\ndaughters will be all gentlemen born.\\r\\n\\r\\nclown:\\r\\nyou are well met, sir. you denied to fight with me\\r\\nthis other day, because i was no gentleman born.\\r\\nsee you these clothes? say you see them not and\\r\\nthink me still no gentleman born: you were best say\\r\\nthese robes are not gentlemen born: give me the\\r\\nlie, do, and try whether i am not now a gentleman born.\\r\\n\\r\\nautolycus:\\r\\ni know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.\\r\\n\\r\\nclown:\\r\\nay, and have been so any time these four hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nshepherd:\\r\\nand so have i, boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nclown:\\r\\nso you have: but i was a gentleman born before my\\r\\nfather; for the king's son took me by the hand, and\\r\\ncalled me brother; and then the two kings called my\\r\\nfather brother; and then the prince my brother and\\r\\nthe princess my sister called my father father; and\\r\\nso we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like\\r\\ntears that ever we shed.\\r\\n\\r\\nshepherd:\\r\\nwe may live, son, to shed many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nclown:\\r\\nay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so\\r\\npreposterous estate as we are.\\r\\n\\r\\nautolycus:\\r\\ni humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the\\r\\nfaults i have committed to your worship and to give\\r\\nme your good report to the prince my master.\\r\\n\\r\\nshepherd:\\r\\nprithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are\\r\\ngentlemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nclown:\\r\\nthou wilt amend thy life?\\r\\n\\r\\nautolycus:\\r\\nay, an it like your good worship.\\r\\n\\r\\nclown:\\r\\ngive me thy hand: i will swear to the prince thou\\r\\nart as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nshepherd:\\r\\nyou may say it, but not swear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nclown:\\r\\nnot swear it, now i am a gentleman? let boors and\\r\\nfranklins say it, i'll swear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nshepherd:\\r\\nhow if it be false, son?\\r\\n\\r\\nclown:\\r\\nif it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear\\r\\nit in the behalf of his friend: and i'll swear to\\r\\nthe prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and\\r\\nthat thou wilt not be drunk;

answer his\\r\\nrequiring with a plausible obedience; agree with\\r\\nhis demands to the point; only refer yourself to\\r\\nthis advantage, first, that your stay with him may\\r\\nnot be long; that the time may have all shadow and\\r\\nsilence in it; and the place answer to convenience.\\r\\nthis being granted in course,--and now follows\\r\\nall,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up\\r\\nyour appointment, go in your place; if the encounter\\r\\nacknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to\\r\\nher recompense: and here, by this, is your brother\\r\\nsaved, your honour untainted, the poor mariana\\r\\nadvantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. the maid\\r\\nwill i frame and make fit for his attempt. if you\\r\\nthink well to carry this as you may, the doubleness\\r\\nof the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.\\r\\nwhat think you of it?\\r\\n\\r\\nisabella:\\r\\nthe image of it gives me content already;

careless, reckless, and fearless\\r\\nof what's past, present, or to come; insensible of\\r\\nmortality, and desperately mortal.\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\nhe wants advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nprovost:\\r\\nhe will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty\\r\\nof the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he\\r\\nwould not: drunk many times a day, if not many days\\r\\nentirely drunk. we have very oft awaked him, as if\\r\\nto carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming\\r\\nwarrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\nmore of him anon. there is written in your brow,\\r\\nprovost, honesty and constancy: if i read it not\\r\\ntruly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the\\r\\nboldness of my cunning, i will lay myself in hazard.\\r\\nclaudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is\\r\\nno greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath\\r\\nsentenced him. to make you understand this in a\\r\\nmanifested effect, i crave but four days' respite;\\r\\nfor the which you are to do me both a present and a\\r\\ndangerous courtesy.\\r\\n\\r\\nprovost:\\r\\npray, sir, in what?\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\nin the delaying death.\\r\\n\\r\\nprovost:\\r\\na lack, how may i do it, having the hour limited,\\r\\nand an express command, under penalty, to deliver\\r\\nhis head in the view of angelo? i may make my case\\r\\nas claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\nby the vow of mine order i warrant you, if my\\r\\ninstructions may be your guide. let this barnardine\\r\\nbe this morning executed, and his head born to angelo.\\r\\n\\r\\nprovost:\\r\\nangelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\no, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.\\r\\nshave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was\\r\\nthe desire of the penitent to be so bared before his\\r\\ndeath: you know the course is common. if any thing\\r\\nfall to you upon this, more than thanks and good\\r\\nfortune, by the saint whom i profess, i will plead\\r\\nagainst it with my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nprovost:\\r\\npardon me, good father; it is against my oath.\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\nwere you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?\\r\\n\\r\\nprovost:\\r\\nto him, and to his substitutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\nyou will think you have made no offence, if the duke\\r\\navouch the justice of your dealing?\\r\\n\\r\\nprovost:\\r\\nbut what likelihood is in that?\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\nnot a resemblance, but a certainty. yet since i see\\r\\nyou fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor\\r\\npersuasion can with ease attempt you, i will go\\r\\nfurther than i meant, to pluck all fears out of you.\\r\\nlook you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the\\r\\nduke: you know the character, i doubt not; and the\\r\\nsignet is not strange to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nprovost:\\r\\ni know them both.\\r\\n\\r\\nduke vincentio:\\r\\nthe contents of this is the return of the duke: you\\r\\nshall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you\\r\\nshall find, within these two days he will be here.\\r\\nthis is a thing that angelo knows not; for he this\\r\\nvery day receives letters of strange tenor;\\r\\nperchance of the duke's death; perchance entering\\r\\ninto some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what\\r\\nis writ. look, the unfolding star calls up the\\r\\nshepherd. put not yourself into amazement how these\\r\\nthings should be: all difficulties are but easy\\r\\nwhen they are known. call your executioner, and off\\r\\nwith barnardine's head: i will give him a present\\r\\nshrift and advise him for a better place. yet you\\r\\nare amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.\\r\\ncome away; it is almost clear dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\npompey:\\r\\ni am as well acquainted here as i was in our house\\r\\nof profession: one would think it were mistress\\r\\noverdone's own house, for here be many of her old\\r\\ncustomers. first, here's young master rash;
